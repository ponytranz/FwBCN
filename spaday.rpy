    "The eight of us chatter back and forth about anything and nothing as we go from the castle to the sauna."
    "And here we are…"
    show bg spapic with s
    "I walk into the sauna a little later than the others and they all turn to greet me, before I step into the comfortable warmth of the water."
    "Surrounded by all the dependable and lovable friends I’ve made in my new life, here in this new and exciting world of Arcadia."
    "A world of possibilities, of experiences and love."
    "A world where I can pave my own future, and more importantly, have fun with the friends on that journey."
    "I’m so grateful to Penelope, who saw reason and defied her upbringing and Queen to help save Arcadia."
    "I’m infatuated with the beauty that is Ruby, a princess-like girl of a high class, with a deep lust hidden within her, and perhaps the craziest sister I’ve ever met."
    "I am enamoured with Honeycrisp, a strong and dependable friend and lover that teaches good virtues and practices them day by day. With a friend like that to support you, no obstacle seems unsurmountable"
    "Where do I begin with Riku? After what she's been through, she may be one of the strongest people I've ever met, both physically and mentally!"
    "But she's so relaxing and easy to hang around, she's by far the most relatable and chilled out person of the group, and I can see myself visiting her often as one of my closest friends."
    "I have immense amounts of respect for Lily, who managed to come out of her shell, and really spread her wings! When I first met her, she barely wanted to leave the house, and now she was the first person waiting for everyone at the castle."
    "Not only that, but she’s taking genuine steps to improve her weaknesses and become a ruler fit to lead Arcadia."
    "Butters has been a dear and loving friend to me each step of the way. Although my being there may have been luck, together we managed to quell the dangers of her succubus form."
    "A dangerous nature that she had always defied, as she persisted to live as a loving and friendly creature, that only sought to help as many as she could."
    "And indeed, she did, as she was the link that saved all of Arcadia in her vast knowledge, and good fortune!"
    "I can’t forget Cream, a girl who’s baking is as delicious as her personality. Every passing moment in the company of this girl is an unforgettable one filled with cheer and excitement."
    "She’s both the life and passion of the party and she has this inexplicable way to just lift everyone’s spirits."
    "And last, there’s Moxie. The girl that may have literally brought me into this world with the simple desire to love me, and if there’s one thing I’ve felt since arriving at Arcadia, it’s thoroughly loved."
    "Moxie hasn’t had the easiest time, but you wouldn’t assume that by her uplifting attitude and constant smile, especially whenever she sees me; she can’t keep that goofy grin off her face."
    "And whenever I'm around her, I can't stop grinning either..."
    "She always tries so hard to better herself, to learn more and as she once told me in her wagon, above all, she wants to make the world smile."
    "I can’t think of a better person to help Lily govern Arcadia, and no doubt they’ll have a long and successful reign that may span thousands of years."
    "But there’s one more person at this sauna…"
    "That is me."
    "With this world of possibilities at my fingertips, the only thing I have left to do now is to look into the future."
    "While I have certainly gotten a lot done in my time here in Arcadia, my life has always felt like it was in a state of limbo. Like a tree that constantly created branches but never sprouted any leaves."
    "So many things have been said and done, but I’ve never once committed or made a big choice, not yet."
    "I justified that as myself figuring out the world, but I think it’s time to start making some big decisions."
    "What lies in the future for me? What will my career be? I think I’m ready to take these steps."
    "And of course, who will be my girlfriend? If anyone?"
    "Hmm…"
    "That’s a good choice indeed…"
    "I lay back in the sauna and close my eyes, sinking into the warmth of the water and allowing myself to drift away."
    "Tomorrow will be another day. I wonder what kind of adventure I’ll get up to."
